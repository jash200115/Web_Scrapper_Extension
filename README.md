# Web_Scrapper_Extension
A customisable web scraper with which you can select certain elements of the web page and store the data in the NoSQL database. For example select some elements in www.example.com/stocks/[input] and then run the scrapper for input = {hero, Honda, maruti }. It will generate a JSON file with all the different pages data.
